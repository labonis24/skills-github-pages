### I was part of a group at MIT. One day, our plans got cancelled for some reason, so our instructors acquired a ball and took us to the field. It was my first time playing soccer in an actual setting game. I absolutely sucked because I did not know how to properly kick a ball.I also felt a burning sensation down in my throat -- probably because I ran so much. Either way, although no one knew how to play at all, we all had so much fun. I think that event made me come to admire the atmosphere of MIT.
